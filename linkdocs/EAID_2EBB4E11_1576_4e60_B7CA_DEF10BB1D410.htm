<p>
Coded Element, in the historical tradition of the ICD codes, appears. It is a kind of linearization </p>
<p>
entity, comprising a Coded Term. However, this Coded Term links back to an Entity ID, which </p>
<p>
traces its lineage to the cloud layer and the ontology layer. Thus, stomach cancer as a Coded </p>
<p>
Term would correspond to related concepts at the Category Level and the Ontology Level. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless, a given linearization may assign different ICD codes in this current model. This is </p>
<p>
highly controversial, and we will need to address this question. For example, in a primary care </p>
<p>
linearization, stomach cancer might have been ICD code of I12.34. Whereas in a mortality </p>
<p>
linearization, the code might be P45.56. Similarly in a morbidity classification the same concept </p>
<p>
might be Q98.76. The implication is that the Coded Term is a subset of the Linearization rather </p>
<p>
than that of the Category Layer. However the linkage to the Category Layer occurs through the </p>
<p>
Entity ID. It is at the Linearization Layer that concepts of inclusions, index terms, exclusions </p>
<p>
come to the fore. These again all derived from the structures and hierarchies associated with the </p>
<p>
category layer.</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Note by Alan Rector: </b>Are these derived solely from the Category Layer or from some joint </p>
<p>
function of the Category and Ontological layers? [<i>Chris: I hope that the universal ID could in </p>
<p>
fact be harmonized with SNOMED. This might be the most practical mechanism to solve </p>
<p>
the mapping problem. This implies that SNOMED would ultimately have to have entities </p>
<p>
that exactly correspond to ICD Categories, at the Category/Sub-Category layer, for </p>
<p>
every Category; this is not presently true. It may de facto cede the ontological definition </p>
<p>
of ICD Categories to SNOMED. It then remains an open question as to whether </p>
<p>
SNOMED would welcome global Wiki-based &ldquo;help&rdquo; in ontologically defining these ICD-</p>
<p>
based concepts.</i>]</p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt"><b>Note by Alan Rector: </b>The derivation/mapping from the other layers to the linearisation layer is </p>
<p>
critical. To some extent it is always going to be arbitrary since there is no single way to choose </p>
<p>
under which system / category to place multisystem diseases. </p>
</span></font></p>
<p><p>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">How are those choices to formalised or at least recorded? [<i>Chris: I neglected to make </p>
<p>
explicit that it is during such linearizations that the requirements for mutually exclusive </p>
<p>
and exhaustive rise to the fore. This means that multiple inheritance, allowed and </p>
<p>
encouraged at the category level, must be pruned to a preferred parent. Similarly, the </p>
<p>
introduction of residual categories (NOS and NEC) would take place at the linearization </p>
<p>
stage. These features introduce the arbitrariness of ICD for which it has long been </p>
<p>
ridiculed. However, this three-layer process makes those choices explicit, and clarifies </p>
<p>
that such choices are based on longitudinal consistency and use-cases rather than being </p>
<p>
purely arbitrary. </i>]</p>
