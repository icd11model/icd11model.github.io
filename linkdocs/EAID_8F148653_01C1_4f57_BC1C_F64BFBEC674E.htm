<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Frankly, this is the least developed of all the diagrams in our new three layer model. </p>
<p>
<b>Simplistically, it is supposed to be a catalog or dictionary of terminology reference </p>
<p>
information, such as elements of SNOMED, elements of Hugo, ICF, or other granular </p>
<p>
terminologies.</b> It is in this domain that traditional ontological models (such as the assertion that </p>
<p>
a myocardial infarction is death of the myocyte due to ischemia) would exist. It is from this </p>
<p>
source that all other layers derive their ontological basis. That being said, I think the model in its </p>
<p>
present form is grossly underspecified and somewhat simplistic. I think if we have </p>
<p>
improvements, they would occur mostly in this layer. Bedirhan has made very clear that ICD 11 </p>
<p>
should have this layer independent of other ontologies, and it should not be ceded entirely to </p>
<p>
terminology such as SNOMED. However, it would be highly desirable that elements in this </p>
<p>
layer should correspond closely if not exactly to elements in SNOMED.</p>

<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">a) As a controlled vocabulary for the category layer.</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">b) As a the source of necessary conditions that define entities.</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">The principle should be that each piece of information should reside in exactly one place,&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">so that for maintenance it can be changed in exactly one place.</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This means that for those entities that do have a representation in the Ontology level, the</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">the representation to them at other levels should be tightly tied to the ontology level.&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Eg. &#160;If there is &quot;Stomach cancer&quot; in the ontology level, then &quot;Stomach cancer&quot; - or whatever</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">corresponding entity in the Category and Linearization levels should reference it and use its</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">presentation object and mappings by default. If they need to over-ride them, they can, but to 
take</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">a trivial example, I should have to translate &quot;Stomach cancer&quot; to &quot;Cancer de L'estomach&quot; (or 
whatever is the correct French) in only one place, and that would&#160;normally be the Presentation 
object on &quot;Stomach Cancer&quot; in the Ontology layer. &#160;</span></font></div>

<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">If we look at SNOMED, we will find &quot;Stomach Cancer&quot; as Carcinoma qualified by site 
Stomach. [1]&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">That's at least a basic definition in formal terms. &#160; Stomach cancer with site Brain doesn't make 
sense.&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">These aren't diagnostic criteria, they are what something is, or at least a part of the definition.&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Actually, of course, this is an inadequate definition. &#160;Stomach cancer is actually a carcinoma 
arising from the mucosa of the stomach. &#160;Primary stomach cancer is also sited in the stomach. 
&#160;Metastatic stomach cancer can be sited anywhere. &#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">From the definition of stomach cancer we can determine both that it is a disease of the Stomach 
and hence of the GI Tract. &#160;From the fact that it is a carcinoma we can identify that it is a solid 
tumour, and from this that it is a solid tumour of the GI tract - if anybody is interested which 
from some recent statistics I've seen they might be.&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><br/>
</div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">From this we can also determine with certainty, if it becomes necessary to differentiate them, 
that&#160;</span></font></div>
<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Carcinoma of the Antrim of the stomach is a kind of Carcinoma of the Stomach.</span></font></div>

<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Not all diseases have such clearcut defiitions. &#160;Myocardial Infarct is a bit fuzzy. Rheumatoid 
Arthritis or Diabetes Type I probably only have very partial definitions, perhaps only that they 
are a &quot;Rhematoid disease&quot; and a &quot;Metabolic disease&quot; respectively.</span></font></div>

first.</span></font></div>
