<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">As I said, this is what I'm now calling the Category Layer, as evident by the ICD 11 category in 
the center. This I see as the core of the classification, against which the subtype-supertype 
hierarchy would be built. The related classes of Presentation, Comment, and Definition, are 
directly derived from the LexGrid model, and accommodate virtually all of the lexical, natural 
language (such as French or Japanese) manifestations. <b>What is strikingly new and different 
is that the historical clinical characteristic, which is at the bottom of that particular 
model, is now linked to a Category exclusively through Clinical Criteria. This means, 
that if a clinical characteristic (such as anatomic site, genomic underpinning, or related 
characteristic) is not manifest in a clinical criteria, it has no role in the model. </b>This is 
made explicit by the cardinality. Closely related to this are the Sanctioning Rules, which we 
chose to attach to clinical criteria. This we borrowed directly from Stephanie and Can's 
previous representations. <b>I think this is the core of what I see ICD 11 being, with few 
restrictions on the subtype-supertype hierarchy (meaning that multiple inheritance is 
permitted in this layer). Specifically, these not need to be mutually exclusive at this 
phase of ICD 11 manifestation. </b>Notions such as mutually exclusive and for that matter 
exhaustive can and should occur at the serialization layer.</span></font></p>

<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">I understand completely why Chris wanted to allow broader-than/narrower than rather than 
pure subclass links in the Category layer. &#160;They are much easier for people to use for browsing 
and searching for material than a strict class hierarchy. &#160;</span></font></div>

<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">I think the problem is that we want the Category layer to do too many things. &#160;For some of them 
we need a &quot;proper&quot; classification hierarchy. &#160;For others we need a broader-than/narrower-than 
thesaurus, probably with lots of bells and whistles for helping people search it efficiently.</span></font></div>

<div align="left"><font face="Times" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">This is how I would replace the existing Index. &#160;My preference would be to do this with SKOS, 
as it provides a well thought out and standardised vocabulary for Thesauri, but there are others. 
&#160; We have a student working on OWL&lt;--&gt; SKOS projections. &#160;We have a very similar 
structure in one of our commercial projects. &#160;If we do this, we can be entirely clear that the 
purpose of this tool is for human browsing and searching. &#160;The entities should all come from the 
other hierarchies, but they could be supplemented with Presentation_entities arbitrarily. &#160; Ideally, 
there would be a defined projection, e.g. that broader-than was the union of kind-of, part-of 
and causes (so that Diabetes is broader than Diabetic Nephropathy)&#160;</span></font></div>
