concern clinical manifestations, which should be independent of language.</span></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Alan Rector: I would have expected language either to be in a separate &quot;layer&quot; or attached to </p>
<p>
either the Ontological or linearization layer. [<i>Chris: Language is at this layer because I see </p>
<p>
language issues (Synonyms, preferred terms, language specific translations, and other </p>
<p>
&ldquo;Presentation&rdquo; elements from the LexGrid model) as universal across the Category </p>
<p>
Layer and all derivative linearizations. I see such &ldquo;category metadata&rdquo; as intrinsic to the </p>
<p>
classification, rather than borrowed from externalized catalogs of terminologies implicit </p>
<p>
in the Ontology Layer. For this reason, I believe is should remain at the Cateogory Layer, </p>
<p>
which I have always seen as the heart of ICD11.</i>]</p>

<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">Alan Rector: A broader point is that I would be happier if all of the external annotations - </p>
<p>
language, mappings, etc. were more clearly separated from the domain information. [<i>Chris: I </p>
<p>
have no problem make these distinctions more clear in the diagram somehow (placement, </p>
<p>
color, etc). However, from a content relationship perspective, I think the linkages are </p>
<p>
reasonable as we&rsquo;ve rendered them.</i>]</p>
