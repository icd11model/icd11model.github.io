<div align="left"><font face="Calibri" size="3"><span style="font-size:11pt"><b>Symptoms and Signs</b>: In the ICD-11, no distinction will be imposed between signs and 
symptoms as their differentiation may be confusing in care practice or medical records. 
Symptoms generally refer to indication of a disease or disorder especially experienced by a 
patient as sensations which may show that they are experiencing a health related problem. 
Signs refer to evidence recognized by the patient, doctor, or others of a health-related problem 
using hands, ears, eyes and nose and some diagnostic instruments.&#160; Enlisting of signs and 
symptoms ensures a level of quality when identifying the appropriate ICD category.&#160;&#160; Knowledge 
from health sciences will be elaborated by the TAGs as defining characteristics of the ICD 
categories. In most instances specialty adaptations and WHO Guidelines refer to this 
information.&#160;&#160; The potential value sets include SNOMED-CT and LOINC. </span></font></div>
