<font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span style="font-size:12pt">A type 2 excludes note represents &quot;Not included here&quot;. An excludes2 note indicates that 
the condition excluded is not part of the condition it is excluded from but a patient may 
have both conditions at the same time. When an Excludes2 note appears under a code it is 
acceptable to use both the code and the excluded code together. (Note: From ICD10CM)</span></font></p>
