sometimes be related to its treatment (e.g. Insulin Resistant Diabetes) or refer to Reason for 
Encounter (e.g. vaccination, dosing).&#160; In addition, various WHO programmes promote and 
practice coupling diagnosis with management (such as Integrated Management of Childhood 
Illness, Integrated Management of Adult Illness) as in common health services use of 
classification is strongly associated with management guidelines.&#160; Similar approaches have been 
taken by certain National Guidelines and WHO is requested to link the ICD categories to 
recommended interventions.&#160; A formal mechanism to enable this linkage or articulation is 
therefore required.&#160; Current ICD versions in certain specialty adaptations already make 
references to treatment and other management interventions. It will also enable linkages to 
International Classification of Health Interventions or its national equivalents to ensure quality 
for better health information systems including casemix.&#160; Potential value sets include 
International Nonproprietary Names, WHO Drug Dictionary, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(ATC) Classification System and other terminologies such as SNOMED-CT.&#160; </span></font></div>

it is important to enable the input of different forms of treatment. Still, it should be specified as 
well who is the publishing authority of the respective treatment, e.g WHO, Medical board xyz, 
etc.. </span></font></div>
